Where they live
dc:title is stored under the asset node at jcr:content/metadata/dc:title (e.g., /content/dam/.../asset.jpg/jcr:content/metadata).

jcr:title is typically stored directly on the content node it titles, such as a pageâ€™s jcr:content node, a folder node, or a component/resource node.

Typical usage in AEM
Assets: authoring and search facets generally rely on dc:title; the Assets metadata editor reads/writes this field.

Pages/components: authoring UIs and Core Components often read jcr:title for display headings and navigational labels.
